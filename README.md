# ArmorSoundMod

Some armors in The Witcher 3 have metal/chainmail sounds when walking around which can be annoying and distracting. 
This mod changes all armors to have the quiet leather sounds.

To install, place the modArmorSound folder into "The Witcher 3/mods". Create the mods folder if it does not exist. 

Note: the name modArmorSound is important. The mod folder must start with lowercase "mod" to be recognized by the game.
