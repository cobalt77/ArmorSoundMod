# ArmorSoundMod

Some armors in The Witcher 3 have metal/chainmail sounds when walking around which can be annoying and distracting. 
This mod changes all armors to have the quiet leather sounds.

To install, place the ArmorSoundMod folder into The Witcher 3/mods folder. Create the folder if it does not exist.
